## Networking Lab
Fuzz a networked target.
* Why networked fuzzing is hard
* How FAS handles it

## Demo: Bacnet
* What is Bacnet
* Write a SMART config for a networked target
* Identify ports, configs, etc via strace
* Gotchas: Seeds, daemonization, configs, libraries, modules
* Demonstrate a crash.

## Lab: Lighttpd
The student will apply their knowledge to fuzz lighttpd.  We will provide
the missing libraries, modules and server configuration file.  The
student must figure out how to use those to write the SMART config.
