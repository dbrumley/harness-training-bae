## Network Binary Lab
In this lab, we will package a network binary for analysis through
Mayhem. This will also cover more in depth the configuration
options for Mayhem.

### Background
This is an introductory lab to teach students how Mayhem accepts
binaries listening on a network socket easily and without harnessing.
Fuzzing networked targets is challenging.  It raises the question:
how does one control the data sent over the socket?  At ForAllSecure we
solve this by emulating network calls.  In this lab we explore fuzzing
a networked target, and some of the more complex aspects of harnessing,
including identifying missing modules and configuration files
required by the target.

### Requirements
* Mayhem
* Your favorite editor

### Mayhem Configuration
The SMART config for networked targets requires specific fields to be
populatated.  The fields are as follows:

* URL: This contains the protocol the target uses (udp or tcp), the ip
address of the target (localhost), and the port the target listens/connects
on.  It has the form: `<protocol>://localhost:<port>`
* is_client: True or False dependening on whether or not the target is
a client
* timeout: Timeout in ms of how long to wait before closing the network
connection

Here is an example config:
```
{
    "fuzzers": [
        {
            "target": "root/myserver",
            "target_args": [],
            "network": {
                "url": "udp://localhost:124",
                "is_client": false,
                "timeout" : 2000
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
### Example 1: NGINX

NGINX is a popular web server.  Below we walk through the steps of how
to run Mayhem on it.

NGINX can be installed with:
`sudo apt-get install nginx`

1. Package the target: `mayhem package /usr/sbin/nginx`
2. Edit the config to add required commandline arguments for NGINX.
NGINX is run as follows:
`nginx -p . -c nginx.conf`
The configuration file is provided in `nginx/nginx.conf`.  Copy this to
the root directory generated by `mayhem package`.  Now we know
how to fill out the `target_args` field.
```
{
    "fuzzers" : [
        {
        "target" : "root/nginx",
        "target_args" : ["-p", ".", "-c", "root/nginx.conf"],
        "library_path": "root/lib"
        }
    ]
}
```
3. Add the network fields to the config.  NGINX listens on port 8080 and is
TCP.
```
{
    "fuzzers" : [
        {
        "target" : "root/nginx",
        "network" : {
            "url" : "tcp://localhost:8080",
            "timeout" : 2000,
            "is_client" : false
        },
        "target_args" : [],
        "library_path": "root/lib"
        }
    ]
}
```
4. Upload to Mayhem and begin fuzzing.
`mayhem upload nginx_package/ --start-sword --duration 30`


### Example 2: Bacsrv
Mayhem is trivial to use if you know how to run the target application.
However, this isn't always the case.  Often at ForAllSecure we know
nothing about the target.  Below we walk through our workflow for
how to run Mayhem on an unknown target.

The target is bacsrv, a little know server.

1.  Get context by googling the target.  We see Bacnet is a data
communication protocol for building automation control and
networks.  Bacsrv implements this protocol.

2. Run `mayhem package` to pull all the dependencies for the binary
  and create a default Mayhem configuration file.

3. Edit the network config.  Follow the below steps to figure out
the correct information:


    a. Run the target to see if it provides anything useful.
```
$ ./bacserv
BACnet Server Demo
BACnet Stack Version 0.9.1
BACnet Device ID: 260001
Max APDU: 1476
```
Unfortunately, the above output doesn't tell us anything.

    b.  Run strace to identify the port and protocol.
```
strace -f -o /tmp/slog ./bacsrv
```
`-f` indicates follow children, and `-o` is the file our results are written to.

    c.  Because this is a server, we know it binds to a port.  Grep for bind in the results:
```
$ grep bind /tmp/slog
20399 bind(3, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(47808), sin_addr=inet_addr("0.0.0.0")}, 16) = 0
```
We see that the target is IPV4 (AF_INET) and bound to port 47808.

    d.  To identify the protocol, grep for `socket`.
```
$ grep socket /tmp/slog
20399 socket(PF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_IP) = 3
20399 socket(PF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_IP) = 3
20399 socket(PF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_UDP) = 3
```
We see this uses UDP.

4.  The package is ready, to begin fuzzing run:
`mayhem upload bacnet/ --start-sword --duration 30`

### Tips
* Run the help menu to see what capabilities are available.  Always look
for the option to run the target in the foreground (ie don't daemonize).
* Strace can be used to identify missing configuration files or modules.
* A good starting corpus is very important.  A good place to start is by
capturing real network requests.

### Exercise: Lighttpd
There are two variants of the lighttpd exercise: moderate and hard.

1. Moderate:  The student must edit `lighttpd_package/config.json` to reflect the
correct commandline arguments and network settings. The package is already
provided in `lighttpd_package`. The command for how to run lighttpd is provided
in `lighttpd_package/run.sh`. The port and protocol lighttpd uses is specified
in `lighttpd_package/README.md`.  Once the student has completed this task,
upload the package and review the fuzzing results.

2. Hard: The student can install lighttpd on their own, run `mayhem package`,
add missing dependencies (lighttpd requires modules and a configuration file),
and determine the port/protocol required by lighttpd.

### Conclusion
This lesson went into the details of the Mayhem configuration file and showed
how to package network binaries.
